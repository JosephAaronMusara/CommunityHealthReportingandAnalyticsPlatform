# CommunityHealthReportingandAnalyticsPlatform
A platform that allows local health workers and community members to report health incidents (e.g., symptoms, disease outbreaks) anonymously, without going to a health centre. The platform will use AI to analyze the data, identify patterns, and provide insights for local healthcare providers and authorities to act upon.
